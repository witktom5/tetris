# Tetris

[Live version](https://witktom5.github.io/tetris/)

## Overview

My first attempt at creating a game. It's a clone of the legendary video game of the same name. Main rules are pretty much the same. You gain points and progress through levels (which just increases the game speed). More rows filled at once means more points. You can restart or pause the game (it also pauses/unpauses itself when window loses/gains focus, for example if you go on another tab in your browser).

## Technologies

Just HTML, JS and CSS.

## How to run

Download and run index.html in your browser or go with the [live version](https://witktom5.github.io/tetris/) on GitHub Pages.

## License
